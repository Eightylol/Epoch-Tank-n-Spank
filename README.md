# The Universal Basics

### What counts as ‚Äúavoidance‚Äù?

* **Miss** (the mob misses you)
* **Dodge**
* **Parry** (not for druids)
* **Block** (mitigation, not avoidance, but it occupies space on the attack table and can ‚Äúpush off‚Äù bad outcomes)

### Defense skill
* Each **+1 Defense skill** gives **+0.04%** Miss, Dodge, Parry, and Block vs. melee and **‚Äì0.04%** chance to be crit.
* Base defense skill at 60 is 300. To be **crit-immune** vs. level 63 (raid boss) you need **440 Defense skill** total.

### Crushing blows & the attack table (level 63 attacker):
* A boss can land **crushing blows (150% damage)** on targets 3 levels lower.
* You can push crushing off the table if your Miss + Dodge + Parry + Block ‚â• **102.4%** at the moment of the hit. (Only shield tanks can realistically do this at 60 because block chance is the ‚Äúbig handle.‚Äù)
* **Crits** must be removed separately (Defense/class talents) so they don‚Äôt occupy space on the table.

### No player DR on dodge/parry.
* The **diminishing returns** on player dodge/parry arrive with the Wrath pre-patch. With TBC talents at 60, your dodge/parry scale linearly with their sources.

### Parry-haste (why expertise matters):
* If the boss **parries your attack**, it can speed up its next melee (parry-haste), which **spikes incoming damage**.
* **Expertise** lowers the boss‚Äôs chance to parry/dodge you, so it‚Äôs a mitigation stat as well as a threat stat.

# Warrior

<br>

## Talents

With the uncertainty of how incoming raids will be tuned, these talent builds rely on using a shield (i know, right?).


<br>

[**Standard build**](https://mel-talent-calc.vercel.app/warrior/350003011-05-0055511033010103501351/0BAFH1B2CEDGIJNFlPQSTUV)
* Cookie cutter def build.

<br>

[**Demo Shout build**](https://mel-talent-calc.vercel.app/warrior/340003-055-0055511033010101501351/0AF1BC2CDEGFIlJNpQSTUV)
* Build with imp demo shout to reduce the damage taken. This is especially useful unless you can rely on other warriors to provide imp demo shout or hunters with owls/bats (screech).

<br>

[**Impale build**](https://mel-talent-calc.vercel.app/warrior/35000301302-03-0055511033010101501351/0AFHIBK2CDEGIlFNJpQSTUV1bbb)
* Recommended for geared tanks with at least 18% critical strike chances before buffs, which is the threshold where trading 2 points from  Cruelty to activate  Impale instead becomes a small threat increase. 
* Impale also significantly increases your damage output when not tanking, which is a nice bonus for an off-tank.


<br>

## Stats

**Notable talent/stat synergies**

* Vitality: +10% Strength, +5% Stamina ‚áí more AP, more block value & HP. 
* Toughness: +10% armor from items (multiplicative with other armor buffs). 
* Anticipation: +20 Defense skill (huge toward crit immunity at 60). 
* Shield Mastery: +30% block value ‚Üí more mitigation and Shield Slam damage/threat. 
* Defiance: +15% threat and +6 expertise. 
---

### Primary Stats

#### Stamina

* Stamina ‚Üí Health. Above the first 20 Stamina, 1 Stam ‚âà 10 HP. Warrior talents Vitality give +5% total Stamina (5/5), so your Stamina is multiplied before converting to HP.
* Both Tauren Racial (Endurance) and Mining Passive (Toughness?) - +5% total Stamina each - multiplies your whole post-Stamina HP, and also scales any flat HP.
* HP formula :
<br> 
    * > HP = (Base HP + 10 x (Stam x 1.05vitality)) x 1.05 endurance x 1.05 mining  
    (...include Kings/fort/etc. where relevant)

#### Strength

* Strength ‚Üí 2 AP per 1 Str and block value at +1 block value per 20 Strength (in Classic/TBC). Block value reduces damage on blocks and also boosts Shield Slam damage. Shield Mastery multiplies your total block value by +30%.

#### Agility

* Agility ‚Üí armor, crit, dodge. Simple rules of thumb at lvl 60: 1 Agi = 2 armor; roughly ~30 Agi ‚âà 1% dodge and ~33 Agi ‚âà 1% crit for Prot Warrior (ratings era numbers; exact class/level scaling varies).

#### Intellect/Spirit

* Minimal value for Prot (mana/regen only).

<br>
<br>

### Secondary stats & ratings

#### Armor
* Physical DR -> DR = Armor / (Armor + K).
* For bosses (level 63), solving for 75% DR gives an armor cap around 17,265 in Classic/TBC-era formulas. <br> (Use K ‚âà 400 + 85 √ó AttackerLevel at 1‚Äì59; special 60+ constants exist‚Äîcommunity math lands you near that 17.2k number vs 63.) 

#### Defense skill
* You need 440 Defense skill to be crit-immune vs L63 (5.6% crit to remove; each Defense skill above attacker reduces crit chance by 0.04%).
* Anticipation (Prot) gives +20 Defense skill by itself. 

### Block rating/value.
* Block chance comes from block rating/defense. 
* Block value reduces hit size and fuels Shield Slam. 
* Shield Block and Shield Mastery scale your block value (and Slam) multiplicatively. 

#### Expertise
* Each 1 expertise reduces enemy dodge and parry by 0.25%. 
* Prot gets +6 expertise skill from Defiance (3/3) in TBC. 

#### Hit Chance

**Bosses are level 63**: melee special hit cap is ~8% (9% ‚Äúon gear‚Äù).


<br>
<br>

## Threat 

### Core rules (what threat is)

* Every mob keeps a threat table. Whoever has the most threat is the target (unless taunted, stunned, etc.). Melee DPS must exceed the tank by 110% to pull; ranged must exceed by 130%. 
* Damage ‚Üí threat at 1 threat per 1 damage (before multipliers).
* Healing generates 0.5 threat per point of effective healing, and that healing threat is evenly split among all enemies you‚Äôre in combat with. Overheal is 0 threat.
* ‚ÄúPower gains‚Äù like rage from Bloodrage / potions generate threat (‚âà 5 threat per 1 rage) and stance/form threat multipliers do not affect this.
* Threat modifiers (stance/form, talents, Salvation, etc.) are multiplicative with each other.

<br>

> **Disclaimer**: There is a lot of custom rework on classes for Project Epoch, and some numbers may vary. <br>
>In the time of writing, there is also a lot of issues with all classes and abilities, and some of these spells/abilities might not work as intended for the time being..

<br>
<br>

<br>

### Built-in multipliers as a Protection Warrior

* **Defensive Stance**: √ó1.30 to almost all threat you cause.

* **Defiance (3/3)**: +15% more on top ‚Üí 1.30 √ó 1.15 = 1.495√ó to your ability/damage threat (multiplier). (Battle/ Berserker Stance are √ó0.8.) 
>Multipliers are multiplicative with everything else (Salv, etc.).

<br>

### Ability-by-ability

* **Shield Slam** Threat = (damage) (scales with Block Value) + an innate flat bonus, then √ó modifier.

* **Devastate** threat ‚âà (50% normalized weapon damage + 35√óstacks damage) + +101 innate threat, then √ó modifier; with 5 stacks that worked out to ~444 raw before stance.
>**Patch 2.3**: Devastate ‚Äúcombines the effects of Sunder Armor‚Äù and is affected by all talents/items that affect Sunder‚Äîi.e., when you add a Sunder via Devastate you also get Sunder‚Äôs flat threat; refreshing at 5 stacks does not add a new Sunder.

* **Sunder Armor**: Flat +301 threat per application (Rank 6) with no damage; multiply by modifier. Still generates threat even past 5 stacks (but doesn‚Äôt stack further).

* **Revenge**: Cheap, off-CD when it lights: damage + a flat bonus (rank-based; commonly ~+200 at level-70 ranks) ‚Üí then √ó modifier. Pound it whenever it procs.

* **Heroic Strike**: Adds damage and a flat +196 threat (Rank 10) to that swing, then √ó modifier. Remember: HS replaces the rage you‚Äôd gain from that white hit, so it‚Äôs only efficient when you‚Äôve got spare rage.

* **Thunder Clap**: Base threat = 1.75 √ó damage done, then √ó modifier. In TBC it hits up to 4 targets. Use it for opener ‚Äúglue,‚Äù not for sustained AoE TPS.

* **Demoralizing Shout**: Very small fixed threat (treat it as utility/mitigation, not real TPS).

* **Taunt**: Sets your threat equal to the current target‚Äôs highest (no bonus), then forces attacks for 3s. Follow it with a big threat move (Shield Slam/Devastate).

<br>

### Quick Math

Modifier = 1.495 (Defensive + Defiance).
* **Generic hit** (no special bonus): Threat = Damage √ó 1.495. 

* **Sunder**: Threat = 301 √ó 1.495 = 450 per GCD. 

* **Devastate** (5 stacks, 2.0.x baseline): ~444 √ó 1.495 ‚âà 664 per GCD. If you apply a Sunder with Devastate (2.3+), add Sunder‚Äôs flat threat before multiplying. 

* **Shield Slam** (example): if it hits for 800 and we use ~+300 flat: (800 + 300) √ó 1.495 ‚âà 1,645 threat. 

* **Revenge** (example): if it hits for 400 and we assume ~+200 flat: (400 + 200) √ó 1.495 ‚âà 898 threat.

* **Heroic Strike** (example swing): if HS adds +176 damage and +196 threat and your swing‚Äôs post-mitig damage add is 400 ‚Üí (400 + 196) √ó 1.495 ‚âà 894 threat (but account for HS rage cost/opportunity).

* **Thunder Clap** (example): if it deals 120 to each of 4 mobs: per mob 120 √ó 1.75 √ó 1.495 ‚âà 314 threat (cap 4 targets). 

<br>

### Threat examples with math

#### Single-target boss opener (no external buffs)

Assume: Shield Slam hits for 800; Devastate at 5 stacks; Revenge lights; Sunder as needed.

* **Shield Slam**: (800 + ~300) √ó 1.495 ‚âà 1,645 threat. 

* **Devastate (5 stacks)**: ~444 √ó 1.495 ‚âà 664 threat (refresh only). If this GCD adds a Sunder stack (2.3+), add +301 √ó 1.495 ‚âà 450 more. 

* **Revenge**: (~400 + ~200) √ó 1.495 ‚âà 898 threat. 

* **Fillers**: Sunder (‚âà450) when Devastate isn‚Äôt optimal (e.g., building early stacks) or you‚Äôre rage-starved; HS only if you‚Äôre floating rage. 

> Practical prio: Shield Slam on CD ‚Üí Revenge on proc ‚Üí Devastate (build/maintain stacks) ‚Üí Sunder only while stacking / if you can‚Äôt Devastate ‚Üí HS to bleed excess rage.


#### 5-mob trash pull (glue + tab threat)

* **Thunder Clap** hits 4 targets for ~120 ‚Üí ~314 threat each (√ó1.495, 1.75x base), then tab Devastate/Sunder the kill target and runner; Demo Shout for mitigation + a bit of blanket threat; Taunt anything that peels and follow with Shield Slam. 

<br>
<br>

# Quick Notes / Summary

### What avoidance does for you

* You have all three: dodge + parry + block, and you can add a huge, short-duration block chance with Shield Block.
* Primary survival goal: stay crit-immune, and keep crushing off via Shield Block uptime (i.e., have a block on the table every boss swing).
* Avoidance synergy with Shield Block: more dodge/parry means fewer blocks consumed, so your Shield Block charges last the full window ‚Üí more reliable uncrushability.

### Practical trade-offs

* Rage economy: avoidance reduces damage taken, which reduces rage from being hit; in low-damage content you can get rage-starved if you stack only pure avoidance.
* Parry vs. Dodge: parry also hastes your next white swing, giving tiny TPS/rage bumps; but point-for-point, dodge usually gives more raw avoidance at 60.
* Expertise = survival tool: less boss parry ‚Üí fewer parry-hasted boss swings. It‚Äôs not ‚Äúavoidance,‚Äù but it smooths damage and helps your Shield Slam/Devastate land.

### Talent/stat tie-ins

* Anticipation: +Defense skill ‚Üí pushes Miss/Dodge/Parry/Block up and crit down.
* Shield Block / Shield Mastery: crank block chance/value; block reduces hit size and keeps you uncrushable when active.
* Vitality/Toughness: more Strength/Armor, so block value (mitigation) and Slam threat go up.

### Mini check-math (example)

* Suppose you have 18% dodge, 16% parry, 20% block, and you hit Shield Block (+big block chance for a few charges). While it‚Äôs up you might sit around 60‚Äì70% total before Miss/Defense. Add ~5‚Äì10% miss/defense plus Shield Block‚Äôs huge temporary block and you can cross 102.4% ‚Üí no crushes during its window. If a parry/dodge happens, you don‚Äôt spend a block charge, so you‚Äôre safer for the next swing too.

# Paladin

<br>

## Talents

With the uncertainty of how incoming raids will be tuned, these talent builds rely on using a shield (i know, right?).


<br>

[**Deep Prot build**](https://mel-talent-calc.vercel.app/paladin/-0530513300050152521051-050050013/1BECFGLNooooQPSRUV2BEI1H2H1o)
* Avenger‚Äôs Shield build.

<br>

[**Imp Sanctity Aura**](https://mel-talent-calc.vercel.app/paladin/-053050300005013252103-052050113003012/1BECGLNQPSRuuu2BEIHgCLNO)
* Sanctity Aura build.

<br>

[**Vengeance build**](https://mel-talent-calc.vercel.app/paladin/-0530503000050130501-0500505130030125/1BECGLNQS2BEIHLNOGP)
* Sanctity Aura build with Vengeance.


<br>

## Stats

**Notable talent/stat synergies**

* Divine Strength (+15% Str) ‚Üí more AP and block value.
* Sacred Duty (+6% Stamina) + Combat Expertise (+10% Stamina) ‚Üí very efficient EH scaling.
* Anticipation (+20 Defense skill) ‚Üí pushes you toward crit immunity.
* One-Handed Weapon Spec (+5% dmg) and Improved Righteous Fury ‚Üí much stronger threat & 6% DR (with 3/3).
---

### Primary Stats

#### Stamina

* Stamina ‚Üí Health. **Sacred Duty** (2/2) = +6% total Stamina; **Combat Expertise** (5/5) = +10% total Stamina. These are Stamina multipliers (they happen before Stam ‚Üí HP).
* Both Tauren Racial (Endurance) and Mining Passive (Toughness?) - +5% total Stamina each - multiplies your whole post-Stamina HP, and also scales any flat HP.
* HP formula :
<br> 
    * > HP = (Base HP + 10 x (Stam x 1.06SD x 1.10CE)) x 1.05 endurance x 1.05 mining  
    (...include Kings/fort/etc. where relevant)

#### Strength

* Strength ‚Üí 2 AP per 1 Str and block value +1 per 20 Str. Divine Strength (5/5) gives +15% Strength.

#### Agility

* Agility ‚Üí armor/crit/dodge (same general notes as Warrior; Agi is nice for avoidance and crit for Seal/Judge procs, but your TPS core is Holy damage).

#### Intellect/Spirit

* Intellect ‚Üí mana & spell crit. Larger blue bar + more spell crit for Holy Shield/Avenger‚Äôs Shield/Seal/Judgement scaling; Divine Intellect adds +10% Intellect.

<br>
<br>

### Secondary stats & ratings

#### Spell Damage
* Spell damage directly scales Consecration, Holy Shield damage, Avenger‚Äôs Shield, Seal/Judgement of Righteousness, etc. (your AoE threat backbone at 60). 
* One-Handed Weapon Spec (+5% damage) and Improved Righteous Fury (+90% threat, and up to 6% damage reduction at 3/3) are key.

#### Armor
* Physical DR -> DR = Armor / (Armor + K).
* For bosses (level 63), solving for 75% DR gives an armor cap around 17,265 in Classic/TBC-era formulas. <br> (Use K ‚âà 400 + 85 √ó AttackerLevel at 1‚Äì59; special 60+ constants exist‚Äîcommunity math lands you near that 17.2k number vs 63.) 

#### Defense skill
* You need 440 Defense skill to be crit-immune vs L63 (5.6% crit to remove; each Defense skill above attacker reduces crit chance by 0.04%).
* Anticipation (Prot) gives +20 Defense skill by itself. 

### Block rating/value.
* Redoubt (proc block chance), Holy Shield gives huge block chance (and deals damage on blocks). 
* Strength increases block value (mitigation) but Holy Shield‚Äôs damage scales primarily with spell coefficients. 

#### Expertise
* Each 1 expertise reduces enemy dodge and parry by 0.25%. 
* Combat Expertise also grants +5 expertise (i.e., ‚àí1.25% dodge/parry combined), improving white/special connects for SoR/JoR melee pieces and Avengers swings.

#### Hit chance

**Bosses are level 63**: melee special hit cap is ~8% (9% ‚Äúon gear‚Äù), while spells (e.g., Avenger‚Äôs Shield) use the **spell hit table** (effective cap ~16% vs L63), so AS will ‚Äúmiss/resist‚Äù more often unless you gear some spell hit.




<br>
<br>

## Threat


### Core rules (what threat is)

* Every mob keeps a threat table. Whoever has the most threat is the target (unless taunted, stunned, etc.). Melee DPS must exceed the tank by 110% to pull; ranged must exceed by 130%. 
* Damage ‚Üí threat at 1 threat per 1 damage (before multipliers).
* Healing generates 0.5 threat per point of effective healing, and that healing threat is evenly split among all enemies you‚Äôre in combat with. Overheal is 0 threat.
* ‚ÄúPower gains‚Äù like rage from Bloodrage / potions generate threat (‚âà 5 threat per 1 rage) and stance/form threat multipliers do not affect this.
* Threat modifiers (stance/form, talents, Salvation, etc.) are multiplicative with each other.

<br>

> **Disclaimer**: There is a lot of custom rework on classes for Project Epoch, and some numbers may vary. <br>
>In the time of writing, there is also a lot of issues with all classes and abilities, and some of these spells/abilities might not work as intended for the time being..


<br>
<br>

### Built-in multipliers as a Protection Paladin
* **Righteous Fury (RF)**: +60% threat to Holy spells (√ó1.6). With Improved Righteous Fury 3/3 it increases RF‚Äôs bonus by 50%, i.e., +90% total ‚Üí √ó1.9 to (most) Holy-based threat. (It also gives 6% damage taken reduction.)

* **Holy Shield** damage has +35% extra threat baked in (on top of RF). (Base Holy Shield has 4 charges; Improved Holy Shield adds +2/+4 charges and +10/20% damage.)

> Multiplying it all: for a Holy spell without its own bonus, Threat = Damage √ó 1.9 (with Imp RF). For Holy Shield, Threat = Damage √ó 1.35 √ó 1.9.

### Ability-by-ability

* **Consecration** ‚Äî 8-sec ground DoT, 8 ticks (1/sec). Threat is pure damage (Holy) ‚Üí √ó1.9 with RF. (Rank 1 is cheap and still benefits from RF.)

* **Holy Shield** ‚Äî Each block deals Holy damage and gets +35% threat and RF. Your highest TPS when getting hit fast.

* **Avenger‚Äôs Shield** ‚Äî Snap ranged Holy damage on up to 3 targets; great opener. Threat = damage √ó RF. (Rank 3 deals 494‚Äì602 per target before mods.)

* **Seal + Judgement**

  * **Seal of Righteousness (SoR)** ‚Äî Adds Holy damage to every swing; Judgement of Righteousness is direct Holy damage. Threat = damage √ó RF.

  * **Seal of Vengeance (SoV)** ‚Äî (Alliance in original TBC; widely available in TBC Classic) stacks a Holy DoT; strong single-target threat when stacked. DoT + Judgement = Holy ‚Üí RF applies.

* **Retribution Aura** ‚Äî Deals small Holy damage to attackers; every hit is Holy ‚Üí √ó1.9. (TBC guides often quote 26 damage/hit at max rank ‚Üí ~49 threat/hit with RF.)

* **(Greater) Blessing of Sanctuary** ‚Äî When you block, the attacker takes small Holy damage (and you reduce damage taken); Holy damage ‚Üí √ó1.9.

* **Righteous Defense** ‚Äî Multi-target taunt (no damage, no direct threat added) that sets your threat to the current highest for those mobs and forces attacks for 3s.

* **Misc Holy nukes (situational)**: Exorcism/Holy Wrath (undead/demon only) ‚Üí damage √ó RF.

> Patch talent that quietly helps: One-Handed Weapon Specialization (Prot) became ‚Äúincreases all damage by up to 5%‚Äù, which bumps your damage (and thus threat) across the board.

<br>

### Pre-healing & self-heals: how they affect threat

* Heals done before combat starts = 0 threat, because you aren‚Äôt on any mob‚Äôs table yet.

* Heals that land after you‚Äôre on the table generate 0.5 threat per effective heal, split evenly across all mobs you‚Äôre in combat with.

* With RF up, Paladin Holy spells (including heals) contribute increased threat‚Äîso if you Flash of Light yourself after you‚Äôve engaged, you‚Äôll generate extra healing threat while RF is active. (Rule of thumb many use: treat it as ‚Äúhealing threat √ó 1.9‚Äù in TBC with Imp RF.) 

<br>
<br>

### Threat examples with math

>Assumptions for the math below (swap in your actual hits):
> * RF with Imp RF 3/3 ‚Üí √ó1.9 to Holy.
> * Holy Shield has +35% threat on its damage.
> * Sample values are illustrative only.

<br>

#### Single-target opener (boss)

* **Avenger‚Äôs Shield** hits for 550 ‚Üí Threat = 550 √ó 1.9 = **1,045**. 
* **Consecration** (8s) ticks for 150 each √ó 8 = 1,200 damage ‚Üí Threat = 1,200 √ó 1.9 = **2,280**. 
* **Holy Shield**: 3 blocks in the first 10s at 155 each ‚Üí raw dmg 465. Threat = 465 √ó 1.35 √ó 1.9 = **1,191**.
* **Judgement of Righteousness** hits for 300 ‚Üí Threat = 300 √ó 1.9 = **570**.

> Rough total over the first 8‚Äì10s: ~5,086 threat ‚Üí ~510 TPS (heavily dependent on blocks and your actual numbers).

#### 5-mob AoE pull

* **Consecration** ticks 150 each ‚Üí 285 threat per tick per mob (√ó1.9). Over 8s, **2,280 threat per mob**.

* **Avenger‚Äôs Shield** tags 3 mobs for **550 each** ‚Üí **1,045* opening threat to those 3.

* **Holy Shield**: say you consume 8 charges in 10s at 155 each ‚Üí damage 1,240 ‚Üí Threat = 1,240 √ó 1.35 √ó 1.9 ‚âà **3,176**, distributed to whatever is swinging (great front-loaded TPS).

* **Retribution Aura**: if each mob hits you once per sec for 8s at 26 aura damage per hit ‚Üí 26 √ó 1.9 ‚âà **49 threat/hit**. With 5 mobs √ó 8s ‚âà ~1,960 extra splash threat riding passively. (Real hit timers vary.)

* **Blessing of Sanctuary**: each block returns small Holy damage ‚Üí multiply its damage by 1.9 for the threat per block.

> Practical opener: AS ‚Üí Consecration ‚Üí Holy Shield (keep it up) ‚Üí Judge on the runner ‚Üí maintain seal. Toss Righteous Defense if anything peels (it sets your threat to the leader on that target).


<br>
<br>

# Quick Notes / Summary

### What avoidance does for you

* You also have **dodge + parry + block**, but your ‚Äúmake me uncrushable‚Äù button is **Holy Shield** (high block chance with charges, deals Holy damage on block).
* **Primary survival goal**: maintain **Holy Shield** so **Miss + Dodge + Parry + Block ‚â• 102.4%**. If it drops, crushing can return immediately.
* Like Warriors, **more avoidance = fewer Holy Shield charges consumed**, which keeps you ‚Äúcovered‚Äù and smooth.

### Practical trade-offs

* **Mana economy**: less damage taken ‚Üí your healers spend less effective healing, and **Spiritual Attunement** returns less mana; heavy avoidance gearing can make long pulls feel mana-tight.
* **Threat style**: a lot of your threat is Holy damage (Consecration, Holy Shield procs, Seal/Judge). Avoidance doesn‚Äôt raise that directly; spell damage and One-Hand Spec do.
* **Expertise = mitigation**: reducing boss parry also helps you (fewer parry-hasted boss swings).

### Talent/stat tie-ins

* **Anticipation**: +Defense skill ‚Üí more Miss/Dodge/Parry/Block and crit reduction.
* **Redoubt / Holy Shield**: big block chance and block value uptime (Redoubt) ‚Üí smoother hits and better charge coverage.
* **Combat Expertise**: adds expertise (mitigation + TPS reliability) and Stamina (EH), which synergizes with your **avoidance+block** approach.

### Mini check-math (example)

* Say you sit at **15% dodge, 14% parry, 20% block**. With **Holy Shield** up, your block chance spikes; add Miss/Defense and you can reach **102.4%** coverage. Dodges/parries in the window save charges, so you don‚Äôt ‚Äúrun out‚Äù before the next refresh.

* Weapon AP is replaced by Feral Attack Power on druid weapons.
* Strength/Agility and armor are your main levers.
---

### Primary Stats

#### Stamina

* Stamina ‚Üí Health. Bears get very large Stamina multipliers:
    * Dire Bear Form: +25% Stamina baseline (and a massive armor multiplier from leather).
    * Heart of the Wild (5/5): +20% Stamina in Bear/Dire Bear.
    * Survival of the Fittest (3/3): +3% to all attributes (so Stamina +3%), and ‚àí3% chance to be critically hit. (This talent does not by itself make you crit-immune at level 60; you still need additional Defense/Resilience to meet the ~5.6% boss crit reduction.)
* Both Tauren Racial (Endurance) and Mining Passive (Toughness?) - +5% total Stamina each - multiplies your whole post-Stamina HP, and also scales any flat HP.
* HP formula :
<br> 
    * > HP = (Base HP + 10 x (Stam x 1.03SotF x 1.20HotW x 1.25DireBear)) x 1.05 endurance x 1.05 mining  
    (...include Kings/Mark/fort/etc. where relevant)

#### Strength

* Strength ‚Üí 2 AP per 1 Str in Bear. (Agility does not add AP to Bear; that‚Äôs Cat-only.)

#### Agility

* Agility ‚Üí armor, crit, dodge. 1 Agi = 2 armor, plus strong dodge/crit for Bears. Agility is excellent for mitigation and threat (crit ‚Üí Maul/Lacerate TPS), but Stamina/EH is king at 60.


<br>
<br>

### Secondary stats & ratings

#### Armor
* Armor multipliers: Dire Bear Form multiplies armor from leather by roughly ~4√ó (patch texts vary by era; many references list ~+400% from items). Thick Hide (3/3) adds +10% armor from items on top. These stack multiplicatively and make Bears the kings of physical DR at 60. 

#### Defense skill
* Bosses have ~5.6% chance to crit (+3 levels). SotF gives ‚àí3%, so you still need ‚àí2.6% from Defense skill. At level 60 with ratings: 1.5 Defense rating = 1 Defense skill, and 25 Defense skill ‚âà ‚àí1% crit.

#### Block rating/value.
* Can‚Äôt block or parry. You live on Armor + Dodge + Big Health.

#### Expertise
* Each 1 expertise reduces enemy dodge and parry by 0.25%.

#### Hit chance

* Bosses are level 63: melee special hit cap is ~8% (9% ‚Äúon gear‚Äù).

## Threat

### Core rules (what threat is)

* Every mob keeps a threat table. Whoever has the most threat is the target (unless taunted, stunned, etc.). Melee DPS must exceed the tank by 110% to pull; ranged must exceed by 130%. 
* Damage ‚Üí threat at 1 threat per 1 damage (before multipliers).
* Healing generates 0.5 threat per point of effective healing, and that healing threat is evenly split among all enemies you‚Äôre in combat with. Overheal is 0 threat.
* ‚ÄúPower gains‚Äù like rage from Bloodrage / potions generate threat (‚âà 5 threat per 1 rage) and stance/form threat multipliers do not affect this.
* Threat modifiers (stance/form, talents, Salvation, etc.) are multiplicative with each other.

<br>

> **Disclaimer**: There is a lot of custom rework on classes for Project Epoch, and some numbers may vary. <br>
>In the time of writing, there is also a lot of issues with all classes and abilities, and some of these spells/abilities might not work as intended for the time being..

<br>
<br>


### Built-in multipliers as a feral tank

* **Bear/Dire Bear Form**: √ó1.30 threat to all your damage-based threat.

* **Feral Instinct (3/3)**: √ó1.15 more threat (applies only in bear forms).
Together, bears sit at 1.30 √ó 1.15 = 1.495√ó threat on all damage-based sources.

> **Note**: these multipliers do not change healing/mana/rage-gain threat‚Äîthose are unmodified. 

<br>

### Ability-by-ability

Below is what each ability does for threat in TBC. ‚ÄúDamage √ó Modifier‚Äù means ‚Äúwhatever damage the ability deals, multiply the resulting threat by 1.495 - assuming you have the Feral Instinct talent.‚Äù

* **Mangle (Bear)**: No extra threat modifier. Threat = damage √ó modifier. It also debuffs the target so all bleeds (and Shred) deal +30% damage for 12s, which passively boosts Lacerate-tick threat. 

* **Lacerate**: On application it has a flat bonus threat (TBC value widely documented as +285 before multipliers) plus its small direct damage; both are then multiplied by modifier. The DoT ticks (15s total, 5 ticks every 3s) are ordinary bleed damage ‚Üí threat (and are 30% stronger while Mangle‚Äôs debuff is up). 

* **Maul**: A ‚Äúnext-swing‚Äù strike with a flat bonus threat per rank added to its damage, then √ó modifier. (TBC changed Maul from Classic‚Äôs weird multiplier to a rank-based flat threat bonus.) Threat math is (Maul damage + Maul bonus) √ó modifier. 

* **Swipe (Bear)**: No innate bonus threat in TBC; it‚Äôs just damage ‚Üí threat (√ó modifier). Also, it hits up to 3 targets in TBC (not 360¬∞/uncapped until Wrath). 

* **Faerie Fire (Feral)**: Costs 0 rage, does (AP√ó0.15 + 1) damage, and has additional built-in threat in bear forms. Treat it as (damage + internal bonus) √ó modifier; it‚Äôs one of your best GCDs for snap threat on cooldown. 

* **Demoralizing Roar**: Tiny threat; use it for mitigation, not TPS. (Any threat it gives is negligible compared to Mangle/Lacerate/Maul/Swipe.)

* **Thorns**: Every reflected tick is just damage ‚Üí threat, multiplied by your bear modifiers like any damage you deal. (Great passive AoE glue early in a pull.) 

* **Growl (taunt)**: Sets your threat equal to the current target‚Äôs highest threat; it doesn‚Äôt add threat by itself and isn‚Äôt multiplied. Use it to match the leader, then follow with a high-threat ability. 

### How pre-HoTs (self-healing before the pull) affect threat

* If you cast Rejuvenation/Regrowth/Lifebloom on yourself before pulling, the ticks that occur after combat begins generate 0.5 threat per point of effective healing, split evenly across all mobs you‚Äôre in combat with, and not multiplied by bear/stance/talents.

* That means on a big pack, pre-HoTs give you a small, instant spread of threat on everything‚Äîuseful ‚Äúglue‚Äù while your first Swipes/Mangles go out. (Overheal ticks are 0 threat.) 

> **Example (pre-HoT)**: Rejuvenation tick heals you for 800 effective right after you body-pull a 4-mob pack ‚Üí total healing threat = 800√ó0.5 = 400, split 400/4 = 100 threat on each mob (unmodified by bear multipliers).

<br>

### Threat examples with math



#### Single-target opener (no external buffs)

#### Assume:
* Your Mangle hits for 1,200.
* You apply Lacerate (100 direct damage, +285 bonus threat).
* You queue Maul and it hits for 900; assume Maul‚Äôs flat bonus ‚âà +200 (rank-based in TBC).

#### Threat per GCD:
* Mangle: 1,200 √ó 1.495 = **1,794 threat**. 
* Lacerate (application): (100 + 285) √ó 1.495 = **576 threat**. 
* Maul: (900 + 200) √ó 1.495 ‚âà **1,645 threat**. 


Immediate total after those three actions ‚âà **4,015 TPS** worth of lead (not counting white swings).

Lacerate over time: Suppose your Lacerate DoT totals 600 damage baseline over 15s; with Mangle‚Äôs +30% bleed debuff it does 780 total = 156 per tick (5 ticks). Each tick‚Äôs threat: 156 √ó 1.495 ‚âà **233**; over 15s that‚Äôs ~**1,166 extra threat** ‚Äúfor free.‚Äù 

<br>

#### 5-mob trash pull (using pre-HoTs + Swipe)

* Pre-pull Rejuvenation tick lands for 700 effective right as combat starts ‚Üí healing threat = 700√ó0.5 = 350 total, split 350/5 = **70 per mob** (unmodified). 

* Swipe hits 3 targets; assume 300 damage to each ‚Üí per target threat = 300 √ó 1.495 = 449. Two Swipes (tagging different 3-packs) quickly give you **~900 threat** on five mobs, while the pre-HoT glued them at 70 each and Thorns ticks add small, multiplied damage-threat as they swing. (Remember Swipe hits 3 targets in TBC.)

<br>
<br>

### Practical threat priorities (TBC)

#### Single target

* Keep Mangle on cooldown (biggest snap TPS).
* Stack/maintain Lacerate to 5, then refresh; its +285 on apply plus buffed bleed ticks are huge over time.
* Maul when you have the rage (it‚Äôs off-GCD and carries a flat threat bonus).
* Faerie Fire (Feral) on cooldown for free, high snap threat and armor debuff.

#### Multi-target (3+)

* Swipe on cooldown and tab-Mangle through priority targets; sprinkle Lacerate on ones you risk losing. Remember Swipe is 3-target in TBC, so rotate it smartly.

* Pre-HoT yourself and keep Thorns up for passive spread threat on entry.

* Use Growl to match a runner‚Äôs top threat, then Mangle/Maul to leap ahead.

<br>
<br>

### Reference: threat formulas

* **Generic hit**: Threat = (Damage) √ó 1.495 (bear + Feral Instinct). 

* **Lacerate (apply)**: ((DirectDamage) + 285) √ó 1.495. DoT ticks: (TickDamage) √ó 1.495. 

* **Maul**: ((MaulDamage) + MaulFlatBonusByRank) √ó 1.495. (Flat bonus is rank-based in TBC.) 

* **Mangle**: (Damage) √ó 1.495. Also remember Mangle ‚Üí +30% bleed damage (bakes more Lacerate tick-threat). 

* **Faerie Fire (Feral)**: ((AP√ó0.15 + 1) + internal bonus) √ó 1.495.

* **Healing tick after pull**: (EffectiveHeal √ó 0.5) / (#mobs in combat with you). Not multiplied by bear/talents.

* **Rage gains (e.g., pot, Enrage tick)**: Rage √ó 5 threat (unmodified by form/talents).

# Quick Notes / Summary

### What avoidance does for you

* Bears have **no parry** and **no block**; your avoidance is basically **Dodge + (Miss from Defense)**.
* You **cannot become uncrushable** at 60 because you don‚Äôt have block to fill the table. You‚Äôll still **dodge some crushes** (a dodged swing can‚Äôt crush), but crushing stays on the table.
* Your plan is **‚ÄúEH tanking‚Äù**: extremely high **Armor** (Dire Bear + Thick Hide), **huge Stamina**, and solid **Dodge** to cut the number of landed hits.

### Practical trade-offs

* **Rage economy**: avoidance reduces damage taken ‚Üí **less rage from damage**, but bear white swings and Mangle/Maul still give you income.
* **Armor matters more** for you than for shield tanks because it‚Äôs your primary **spike smoothing** (with no block).
* **Expertise** is still quietly defensive (fewer boss parry-hasted swings).

### Talent/stat tie-ins

* **Survival of the Fittest**: ‚Äì3% chance to be crit + **+3% all stats** ‚Üí reduces the Defense/Resilience you need for crit immunity and bumps Dodge (Agi) and Stamina.
* **Heart of the Wild + Dire Bear**: huge Stamina multipliers ‚Üí massive effective health.
* **Thick Hide: +10% armor from items** ‚Üí bigger physical DR.
* **Agility** is a double win: **Dodge + Crit** (threat), and **2 armor per Agi** at 60.

### Mini check-math (example)

* If you‚Äôre sitting around **30‚Äì40% dodge** with buffs, a boss‚Äôs landed swings are way fewer, but the ones that land can still be crushing. Your safety net is the **sheer size of your armor-reduced HP pool**.
